**Problem & Objective**

Flag likely fraudulent transactions in imbalanced payment data (fraud â‰ª 1%) while allowing the user to tune alert volume to business needs.

**Business impact & takeaways**

Imbalanced-aware modeling with tunable alert rate aligns to fraud-ops capacity.

Exportable predictions plug into manual review/queueing with minimal effort.

Feature importance gives quick signals for rule refinement.
